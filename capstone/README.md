This is the capstone project of the Codecademy Web Development course.

Not all measurements as seen on the mockup were adopted, some were changed.

Transitions were added as well.

Not very proud of the css but it works. I learned a lot while programming and will try to avoid the mistake I made in future projects.

Any tips on how to structure the css more effectively are appreciated. I suppose I have to work more with IDs.
